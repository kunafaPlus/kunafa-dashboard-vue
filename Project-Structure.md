## Folder Details and How to Use

### `components/`
- **Purpose**: Houses reusable Vue components like buttons, modals, or forms.
- **How to Use**: Add new components here and import them into views or layouts as needed.

### `constants/`
- **Purpose**: Stores application-wide static values (e.g., API endpoints, roles, or configuration settings).
- **How to Use**: Add new constants as separate files or organize them into logical groups.

### `dummy-data/`
- **Purpose**: Contains mock or sample data for prototyping or testing during development.
- **How to Use**: Update or replace with real data when connecting to live APIs.

### `formatters/`
- **Purpose**: Provides functions to format data such as dates, strings, or numbers.
- **How to Use**: Add specific formatting utilities (e.g., `dateFormatter.js`) and import them where needed.

### `layouts/`
- **Purpose**: Defines reusable layout templates for wrapping views, such as Admin or Authentication layouts.
- **How to Use**: Add new layouts here and configure them in `router/index.js`.

### `libs/`
- **Purpose**: Includes custom libraries or external helper modules that are not part of Vue's core.
- **How to Use**: Add any third-party integrations or custom helper files here.

### `main.js`
- **Purpose**: Entry point of the application. It initializes the Vue instance, plugins, and root components.

### `plugins/`
- **Purpose**: Manages Vue plugins or third-party integrations.
- **How to Use**: Add or configure plugins such as Vuex, Vue Router, or global event buses.

### `router/`
- **Purpose**: Configures navigation routes using Vue Router.
- **How to Use**: Add new routes or modify existing ones in `router/index.js`.

### `services/`
- **Purpose**: Handles API calls and back-end communication.
- **How to Use**: Add new service files for specific modules (e.g., `userService.js`) to manage API requests.

### `utils/`
- **Purpose**: Provides helper functions that are not tied to a specific component or service.
- **How to Use**: Add general-purpose utility functions (e.g., debouncers, validators).

### `views/`
- **Purpose**: Stores page-level Vue components, representing screens like Dashboard, Login, or Settings.
- **How to Use**: Create new pages as `.vue` files and register their routes in `router/index.js`.

## How to Contribute

### Custom Styles
- Tailwind CSS is used for styling. To add global styles, configure `tailwind.config.js` or include SCSS files in `App.vue`.
- Local component styles should be scoped to avoid global conflicts.

### Adding a New Component
1. Create a `.vue` file in the `components/` directory.
2. Define the template, script, and styles as required.
3. Import and use it in views or layouts.

### Creating a New Page
1. Add a `.vue` file to the `views/` directory.
2. Register the new route in `router/index.js` with its path, name, and component.

### Adding API Services
1. Create a new service file in the `services/` directory.
2. Define API calls using libraries like `axios` or `fetch`.
3. Import the service into components or Vuex store for use.
